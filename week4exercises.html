			//the Eagle class has already inherited the private variables from the privateBird class.
			//You can't change them in this way.
			baldEagle.food = "candy";

			console.log(baldEagle.getFood());

			//Howver, you can still change it to weird values in the legal way, so it's not perfect.
			baldEagle.setFood("candy");

			console.log(baldEagle.getFood());

			//Finally, an example of polymorphism
			console.log(bluebird.dive());
			console.log(baldEagle.dive());

			//As you can see, though these two functions are named the same
			//And one is inherited from the other,
			//The dive function has been overwritten.
