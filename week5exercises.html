			//There are three types of bugs! Errors, Exceptions and Warnings.

			//Errors are when something goes wrong in the code. 
			//It could be a user error, programmer error or a system error.
			

			//One very common type of error is an exception.
			//This is an error that displays an error message when activated, letting the user know what has triggered it.

			//This will trigger a ReferenceError
			//unicorn();

			//This will trigger a SyntaxError, as the function call is missing a closing parenthesis.
			function rideUnicorn(rider) {
				return rider + " rides a unicorn";
			}


			//console.log(rideUnicorn("Steve");

			//The above error will also give a Stack Trace, which shows exactly where the error was triggered, allowing you to diagnose what the error is.


			//Warnings are errors in programming that are not serious enough to crash the program. Javascript is a particularly intelligent language and can handle ambiguity in programming.

			//This will generate a warning that the 'pi' variable has not been initialized.
			pi = 3.14159;

			//Strict mode was introduced into JavaScript as a way of detecting bad coding practices that made code less efficient. Strict mode treats warnings and minor exceptions aas errors.

			//You can use strict more in specific functions, or in general use.

			//This code, which previously triggered a warning, now triggers an error.
			function triggerError() {
				'use strict'
				myPi = 3.14159;
			}

			//triggerError();

			//As new functions and features are added and removed from the Web constantly, programs need to be able to check if features are available and act accordingly.
			if (window.boat) {
				boat.goFishing();
			}


			//Alerts are a common feature in debugging, since they pause a program in order to send a notification to the user. This allows developers to track a program as it runs.
			function nameMe(name) {
				if (typeof name === "string") {
					alert("Your name is " + name);
				} else {
					alert("Please enter an actual name");
				}

			}

			var input = 4;

			console.log(typeof input);

			nameMe(input);

			//There are also built-in JavaScript functions used for debugging, like the 'throw' function. Throw allows a user to create a custom breakpoint that will stop the program. 

			function nameMeToo(name) {
				if (typeof name !== "string") {
					throw new TypeError('Names must be a string type');
				}
			}

			//nameMeToo(input);

			//Errors can also be caught using the try-catch method. The try block attempts to execute some code, and if an error is triggered, the catch block prints the error and executes other pieces of code.

			try {
				nameMeToo(input);
			} catch (error) {
				console.error("Error occurred: ", error);
			}
