			//The main gist of this week's lesson was asymmetric functions and their use in creating dynamic web pages.
			//JavaScript itself has many functions to make this happen: callbacks, promises and json loaders.

			//This program calls an api hosted by NASA, which displays one picture per day.
			//However, one picture is not enough! We want more! So this program also calls the API with a radom date
			//allowing us to see pictures from previous days.

			//These set up the basic elements of the program, to allow our functions to call them easier. 
			//This can simplify things so we don't enter callback hell.
			const spaceButton = document.getElementById('space'); 
			const outputDiv = document.getElementById('output');
			const spacePhoto = document.getElementById('spacePhoto');

			//These two functions are set up to clear the loading output after the picture has finished loading.
			function wait(callback){ setTimeout(callback, 2000);}

			function clearOutput() {
				outputDiv.innerHTML = "";
			}

			//This is the button that loads the picture. By putting all our set up in here, we also ensure that the date can be randomized and the API called multiple times without refreshing the page, making the program truly dynamic.
			spaceButton.addEventListener('click', () => {

				//Creating a random date.
				var date = new Date(+(new Date()) - Math.floor(Math.random()*100000000000));
				console.log(date);

				//Setting the proper format that the API requires.
				var spaceDate = date.toISOString().substr(0, 10);

				//Preparing the API request, using our api key and our random date. It took me a little while to figure out API keys.
				const spaceURL = 'https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=Aj3aZZ1ZX9H5YfwheMgVWGyYVwghvILvpOU9MGvt&date=' + spaceDate;

				//Setting our output clear on a timer.
				wait(clearOutput);

				//Getting the data from NASA's API
				fetch(spaceURL) 
				.then( response => { outputDiv.innerHTML = "Photo loading..."; 
					if(response.ok) { return response; } 
					throw Error(response.statusText); }) .then( response => response.json() ) 
				.then( data => spacePhoto.src = data.url ) 
				.catch( error => console.log('There was an error:', error)) },false);
